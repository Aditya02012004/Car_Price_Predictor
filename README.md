# Car_Price_Predictor

This Application predicts the Price of the Cars on the basis of Company Name, Car Model, Fuel Type, Purchase Year, Numbers of Kilometers driven as this is Linear Regression Problem we have used r2_score to Model the dataset and created a website using Flask framework & HTML and little bits of CSS and Javascript to create a website

# Approach to the Problem

Step 1 - Understand the Dataset
Step 2 - Clean the dataset through each column
Step 3 - Get the Super Clean data

# Model the Dataset 

Step 1 - Using sklearn we have train and test the model as it is Linear Regression Problem
Step 2 - We have applied R2_Score to train the Model
Step 3 - Then we created the pipeline through which we can directly train the model
Step 4 - Again Calculated the R2_Score

# Creating Website to Test the Model

Step 1 - Used Flask Framework to Create the website
Step 2 - Maintain the simple CSS Style for webpage
Step 3 - Design Out the HTML to create the Structured webpage and also used little bits of Bootstrap to make webpage look intractive
Step 4 - Run out the web page
